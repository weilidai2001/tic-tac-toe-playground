Your objective is to build a client side web application for a Tic Tac Toe game in React and Typescript.

Standard Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. The first player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.

Wild Tic Tac Toe is similar to Tic Tac Toe, but instead of one player always placing X, and another player always placing O, each player can place whatever they chose on their turn. The first player to get 3 consecutive in a row of either X or O wins.

The game you build should support the following key features:

The game can be played on a 3 by 3 grid.

It should support two variations: Standard and Wild.

The game can be played in two ways: against the computer or with two players.

There is no need to implement a perfect computer player, but the computer player must be able to play some basic moves. For example, play a winning move if itâ€™s available.
