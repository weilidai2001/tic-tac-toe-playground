Prompt

Your objective is to build a client side web application for a Tic Tac Toe game in React and Typescript.

Standard Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. The first player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.

Wild Tic Tac Toe is similar to Tic Tac Toe, but instead of one player always placing X, and another player always placing O, each player can place whatever they chose on their turn. The first player to get 3 consecutive in a row of either X or O wins.

The game you build should support the following key features:

The game can be played on a 3 by 3 grid.

It should support two variations: Standard and Wild.

The game can be played in two ways: against the computer or with two players.

There is no need to implement a perfect computer player, but the computer player must be able to play some basic moves. For example, play a winning move if it’s available.

No extra points are awarded for a perfect computer player. However, we would like to see how you made your decision for the algorithm chosen.

Please note that additional features will not earn any extra points.

Deliverable

A technical design document in PDF format, using the below technical design template.

In this project, you'll create a technical design document that will outline your technical approach.

Please follow the included technical design template (see below). Keep in mind that the deliverable is meant to be a proof of concept and that our estimate for the implementation of this design, which you’ll complete in a later stage, is ~10 hours.

We are interested in both your solution and the thought process for choosing that particular approach over others given the time allotted. We expect for the technical design to clearly describe:

Any assumptions you made and the rationale behind them.

The approaches you considered for the computer player, their strengths and limitations.

How your computer player solution works in wild mode.

The approaches you considered for another relevant technical challenge, their strengths and limitations.

Risks and mitigation strategies.

Testing strategy

Whether/how you used an LLM to complete any part of this test project submission. It's especially helpful to see the prompts you employed, but you can also disclose general use cases, such as researching particular topics or improving writing quality.

Please make sure that your document is well-structured and easy to understand.

Technical Design Template

Background & Requirements:

What information do people need to understand the problem and approaches? Are there specific requirements for the approaches? This section should have enough information to empower others to participate, but not so much that they swim in it. You may also consider including:

Technical or non-technical constraints

Assumptions and the rationale behind them

Problem Statement 1:

What is the problem that this design attempts to solve? Try to keep it short. If the problem is really complicated consider how it can be broken up.

Approaches for Problem Statement 1:

What are feasible approaches for solving the problem? No one has all the answers and sometimes you need to experiment with different ideas.

Describe approach (1) and state the reason why this approach is or isn't chosen. A diagram may be useful if the approach is complicated.

Describe approach (2) ...

Testing:

How will you test your application code to ensure coverage of all key areas? What do you consider the most critical areas to cover and why? What type of tests will you use?
